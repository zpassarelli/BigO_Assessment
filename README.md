# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation! 
 
 ##
 
  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:
  
 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.
 
    > Big O deals with measuring the time and space efficiency of algorithms when run in the worst possible scenario, that is, when a sorting or searching algorithm must iterate through the entire data set to accomplish its goal.

---
   
 
 2. What 2 things does it measure?
 
    > The time it takes and the memory space needed for an algorithm to do its task.

---
   
 
 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?
    
    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)
    
    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)
    
    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    > **B** shows the order of Big O time complexity from most efficient to least efficient.

4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?
    
   Binary Search
   
   Bubble Sort
   
   Quick Sort (average case)
   
   Linear Search
   
   > Binary Search

---
   
   
   
5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)
    
    O(n log n)
    
    O(n)
    
    O(n^2)
    
    > O(n)

---
    
    
 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)
 
    > O(1) is constant and will have the same complexity regardless of the data size. O(n) and O(n^2) have complexities which are dependent on the data size, and O(n^2) increases at an exponential rate with the data size. 

---
    

7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    > O(log n) complexities usually deal with binary search methods, and O(n) complexities deal with looping through the data. Therefore, an O(n log n) complexity method would contain both binary searching and looping.

  PART TWO: In a new file, write examples of algorithms/functions for each of the Big O complexities below. 
    Upload your file to your repository when complete and submit in Learn --> Exercises.
    
    1. O(1)
    
    2. O(n)
    
    3. O(n^2)
