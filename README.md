# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation! 
 
 ##
 
  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:
  
 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.
 
    > Big O deals with measuring the time and space efficiency of algorithms when run in the worst possible scenario, that is, when a sorting or searching algorithm must iterate through the entire data set to accomplish its goal.

---
   
 
 2. What 2 things does it measure?
 
    > The time it takes and the memory space needed for an algorithm to do its task.

---
   
 
 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?
    
    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)
    
    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)
    
    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    > C shows the order of Big O time complexity from most efficient to least efficient.

4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?
    
   Binary Search
   
   Bubble Sort
   
   Quick Sort (average case)
   
   Linear Search
   
   > Binary Search

5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)
    
    O(n log n)
    
    O(n)
    
    O(n^2)
